# flowers_recognition
*Demo of an artificial intelligence able to recognize some types of flowers*

## Introduction
while doing a project with friends based on plants, I took the responsibility to create an AI named Glwadys, I was able to create a part and that's why I share this A with you.Â I of flower type recognition with a very high accuracy and a very low loss. It was trained with 4323 different images on 320 epochs. 3 convoluted layers were created and 4 connected layers. Several layers were tested until its maximum performance. You can test it by accessing the file flowers_recognition.Ipynb and open it with google Collab, the models are already compiled to save you time.
